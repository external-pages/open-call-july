# Open call for ambitious digital project proposals – Wednesday 1st of July

External Pages is pleased to announce an open call for proposals of ambitious digital projects, which ends on midnight Wednesday 1st of July. 

We are welcoming proposals from artists which embody the context of Covid-19 and the activism of BLM, by embracing, reflecting or further contextualising recent developments, critical debates and political strategies. From navigating the logistics of forming protests, to subverting digital surveillance, galvanising groups around petitions, readings and donation links, recent events have heightened alternatives to capitalist modes of production as well as opposition to forms of oppression from white supremacy to transphobia. Proposals should either directly address this as a subject, begin a dialogue with its wider themes or embrace these strategies directly. 

External Pages was founded to advance critically and politically engaged thinking about capitalism, technology and society. Our most recent solo exhibition of Legacy Russell explored the contributions of blackness to digital space, presenting her video essay BLACK MEME in an immersive digital environment. The themes and presentation of the video challenged assumptions of web design to expose deeper political racial biases.

Successful applicants will be provided with both curatorial and technical support to develop the project. The first exhibition will be featured on External Pages from the 6th of July until the 10th of August, but we are open to hearing proposals for future dates. 

Due to the support of a-n Bursaries, we offer an artist fee of £100.


### About External Pages

External Pages is an online exhibition space, presenting digital projects inspired by anti-capitalist and xenofeminist thought. Every other month, we showcase an artist or collective who push the potential of viewing art on our browsers. The exhibitions we host experiment with web development to question the placement of internet art in galleries, cheat curatorial hierarchies and look at how websites can be appropriated as an emancipatory technology.

### How to Apply

We welcome proposals which ambitiously engage with the focus of External Pages. We accept work in progress, a starting concept, or previously-made work that would benefit from a remodeling as a website. While applicants with coding experience are preferred, this exhibition may be an opportunity for artists with little to no coding skills to realise a project in a digital format as we do offer web development. 

To submit, please fill out the form below. The deadline is at midnight on Wednesday 1st of July. Due to the volume of applications, we aren’t always able to reply to every submission.
